# Hydra Demo — Truth Through Erasure

This repository contains a **runnable demonstration of Hydra Proofs**, a concrete instantiation of the **Oblivious Compute (OC)** primitive.

Hydra demonstrates **distributed correctness through deterministic selection and erasure**, rather than agreement, coordination, or historical replay.

This is a **research demo**, not a product.

---

## What This Demo Demonstrates

- Multiple Hydra nodes (A–E) run as independent processes
- Nodes exchange **full candidate states** over UDP
- Conflicting states are allowed to coexist briefly
- A deterministic rule selects **one surviving state**
- All losing states are **fully erased**
- The surviving state *is* the truth

Divergence is expected.  
Convergence happens by overwrite.

---

## Requirements

### Operating System

- ✅ Linux  
- ✅ macOS  
- ❌ Windows (not supported)

This demo relies on low-level terminal control:

- `termios`
- `tty`
- raw stdin handling

These APIs are not available on Windows.  
WSL is **not guaranteed** to work correctly.

---

### Python Version

- **Python 3.10 or higher required**

Reason:
- Uses modern type syntax (`|`, `Dict[str, Any]`)
- No backward-compatibility shims are provided

Check your version:

```bash
python3 --version
```

---

## Running the Demo (5 Nodes)

Each Hydra node runs in its **own terminal window**.

You will run **five processes**, one per head:

- A
- B
- C
- D
- E

Each node binds to a UDP port.

- Ports must be **unique per machine**
- Port numbers **may be the same across different machines**

---

### Example: Single Machine (Localhost)

Open **five terminals**, then run:

#### Terminal 1 — Head A
```bash
python3 Hydra-ready.py --id A --port 5001 --peers \
127.0.0.1:5002 127.0.0.1:5003 127.0.0.1:5004 127.0.0.1:5005
```

#### Terminal 2 — Head B
```bash
python3 Hydra-ready.py --id B --port 5002 --peers \
127.0.0.1:5001 127.0.0.1:5003 127.0.0.1:5004 127.0.0.1:5005
```

#### Terminal 3 — Head C
```bash
python3 Hydra-ready.py --id C --port 5003 --peers \
127.0.0.1:5001 127.0.0.1:5002 127.0.0.1:5004 127.0.0.1:5005
```

#### Terminal 4 — Head D
```bash
python3 Hydra-ready.py --id D --port 5004 --peers \
127.0.0.1:5001 127.0.0.1:5002 127.0.0.1:5003 127.0.0.1:5005
```

#### Terminal 5 — Head E
```bash
python3 Hydra-ready.py --id E --port 5005 --peers \
127.0.0.1:5001 127.0.0.1:5002 127.0.0.1:5003 127.0.0.1:5004
```

### Running Across Multiple Machines (LAN)

You may also run nodes across **multiple machines** by replacing `127.0.0.1`
with LAN IP addresses.

Each node binds to a local UDP port.  
Port numbers may be the **same across different machines**, but must be **unique per machine**.

Example:
- `192.168.1.101:5001`
- `192.168.1.102:5001`

These are distinct sockets and work correctly.

---

## Controls

- **Left / Right Arrow** — Select target head  
- **Up / Down Arrow** — Select amount  
- **Enter** — Submit transaction (“feed”)  
- **H** — Force resynchronization (HUNGER)  
- **Ctrl+X** — Soft reboot (sever head)  
- **Ctrl+C** — Exit  

A node will **never allow you to target itself**.

---

## Notes on Stability

- This demo uses **UDP**
- Packet loss is expected under heavy load
- Wi-Fi saturation can induce temporary divergence
- The system recovers through overwrite and erasure

This behavior is **intentional** and part of the demonstration.

---

## Important Warnings

This demo intentionally provides **no guarantees** of:

- persistence  
- auditability  
- fairness  
- security hardening  
- Byzantine fault tolerance beyond erasure  

If a state survives, it is the truth.  
If it loses, it disappears completely.

---

## Skeleton vs Demo

This repository may include a **Hydra skeleton**:

- Non-executable
- Illustrative only
- Shows the core selection-and-erasure logic

The skeleton is **not** a reference implementation.

`Hydra-ready.py` is the runnable demo.

---

## License & Intent

Hydra Proofs are published as a **public technical disclosure**.

This demo exists to show that **oblivious convergence is possible**.

If it fails, it fails cleanly.  
If it works, it demonstrates a new computational primitive.
