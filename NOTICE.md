This repository documents **Oblivious Compute (OC)**, a foundational distributed computation primitive, 
along with reference material and an example instantiation (Hydra).

Portions of the concepts described in this repository are the subject of **pending patent applications**.

This repository is published as a **defensive and academic disclosure** of a computation primitive. 
It is not a finished protocol, standard, or commercial product. 
No guarantees are made regarding correctness, fitness for purpose, or suitability for production use.

Oblivious Compute intentionally prioritizes **finality, simplicity, and erasure** over auditability, reversibility, or historical reconstruction.
Systems requiring long-term provenance or post-hoc inspection may not be appropriate candidates for this approach.

If the ideas presented here are incorrect, they are incorrect cleanly.  
If they are correct, they define a new design space.
