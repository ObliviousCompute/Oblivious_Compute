# Oblivious Compute (OC)

Oblivious Compute (OC) is a distributed computation primitive that determines correctness through **selection and erasure** rather than agreement and historical coordination.

Instead of passing messages in chains or preserving logs, OC allows multiple candidate states to exist briefly and then **deterministically collapses them to a single surviving state**. The surviving state is the truth; all others are erased and leave no trace.

OC is a primitive, not a product.

## What Problem Does OC Address?

Most distributed systems assume correctness requires memory:
- message ordering
- logs and replay
- consensus and reconciliation
- long-lived historical state

These assumptions make systems heavy and complex.

Oblivious Compute removes the requirement to remember the past.  
Correctness is defined operationally as **what survives**, not how it was reached.

This repository separates **theory** from **instantiation**.
